Title: Global drought transcriptome analysis of Theobroma cacao reveals complex phytohormone signaling, osmotic regulation, and metabolism 

Abstract:
This study investigates transcriptional changes in roots, leaves, and apices of cacao seedlings under drought stress across a 24-hour diurnal time course. Key regulatory modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in drought response were identified. A core set of 990 drought-responsive genes was shared across tissues and time points, with approximately 500 DEGs showing tissue-specific expression. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed networks involving ABA signaling, homeobox leucine zipper transcription factors, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, and phytohormone signaling pathways linked to biosynthesis and stress responses. Tissue-specific responses included root DEGs regulating water deficit perception and uptake reduction, leaf DEGs involved in stomatal regulation and transpiration control, and apex DEGs related to carbon allocation. Overall, transcriptional changes were highly similar across tissues, indicating a systemic response involving ABA signaling, dehydrins, plasma membrane proteins, osmotic adjustment, redox regulation, and heat shock proteins. Suppressed pathways included secondary metabolite biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis. The diurnal time course enabled identification of early versus late gene response patterns and revealed dynamic fluctuations in gene expression, suggesting fine-tuned stress regulation. These findings provide a comprehensive view of drought adaptation in cacao, highlighting conserved and tissue-specific mechanisms. The insights gained offer valuable targets for breeding and biotechnological strategies aimed at improving drought resilience in cacao and other economically important crops.
