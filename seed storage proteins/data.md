#Tentative title: Transcriptional Architecture of Cacao Seed Development: Integrated Networks Governing Nutrient Storage, Stress Adaptation, and Germination
Abstract:
Seed development in Theobroma cacao requires precise coordination of transcriptional programs governing nutrient accumulation, stress tolerance, and germination readiness. Despite cacao's economic importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying seed maturation remain poorly characterized compared to temperate crops. We performed comprehensive transcriptomic analysis across four developmental stages, Immature Fruit Embryo, Developing Fruit Embryo, Mature Embryo, and Germinating Seed Shoot, to identify gene networks orchestrating cacao seed development. Principal Component Analysis revealed two major transcriptional axes: a primary developmental transition from nutrient storage to metabolic activation, and secondary specialization in membrane trafficking and biosynthetic processes. Hierarchical clustering and co-expression network analysis identified distinct functional modules including seed storage proteins co-regulated with vacuolar trafficking genes (VPS29, VPS38), ABA-responsive LEA proteins (EM1, EM6) integrated with stress adaptation factors, and chromatin remodeling networks centered on REF6. Gene Ontology enrichment revealed stage-specific priorities: epigenetic reprogramming and nutrient reservoir establishment during early embryogenesis, lipid metabolism and structural stabilization during maturation, and vesicle transport with mitochondrial reorganization during germination. Phylogenetic analysis positioned cacao vicilin-like storage proteins within conserved eudicot lineages, supporting functional conservation across taxa. Our findings establish a modular transcriptional architecture where vacuolar trafficking, chromatin remodeling, and stress adaptation are coordinately regulated, providing molecular targets for enhancing seed vigor and climate resilience in tropical crops.

Significance Statement:
Cacao seed development determines crop yield and quality, yet its transcriptional control mechanisms remain underexplored compared to temperate model species. This study reveals the modular architecture of gene networks governing cacao seed maturation through integrated transcriptomic analyses. We identify three major regulatory axes, vacuolar trafficking, chromatin remodeling, and stress adaptation, that coordinate nutrient storage, developmental transitions, and environmental resilience. Key discoveries include the central role of REF6-mediated epigenetic control, integration of storage proteins with vacuolar sorting machinery, and coupling of stress responses with developmental programs. These findings provide the first comprehensive molecular framework for cacao seed development and highlight specific targets (REF6, VPS proteins, storage protein networks) for improving seed performance in tropical crops facing climate challenges.
